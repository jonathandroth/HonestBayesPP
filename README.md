# Replication files for "(Empirical) Bayes Approaches to Parallel Trends" by Kwon and Roth (AEA P&P) 

## Overview

The code and data in this replication package reproduces the two figures in the paper. All of the data used in the paper come from the replication package in Rambachan and Roth (2023), which in turn uses the replication packages from Benzarti and Carloni (2019) and Lovenheim and Willen (2019).

## Data Availability and Provenance Statements

As mentioned above, all of the data used in the paper are from publicly available replication packages.

### Summary of Availability

- [x] All data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Some data **cannot be made** publicly available.
- [ ] **No data can be made** publicly available.

### Details on each Data Source

The `Data/` directory contains the results used in the empirical application, which are taken from the replication package for [Rambachan and Roth (2023)[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7388015].



## Computational requirements

The replication code uses R. Package installation is handled in the script `package-installation.R`.  


The code was last run on a **2019 Macbook Pro with 64GB of RAM running MacOS Version 11.6**, **R 4.3.1**. Approximate runtime is 1 minute.  



## Description of programs/code

- The R script `package-installation.R` installs R packages used in the replication code.
- The R script `bz-application.R` produces the results for the Benzarti and Carloni application.
- The R script `lw-application.R` prodcues the results for the Lovenheim and Willen application.   
- The remaining scripts contain helper functions used in the calculations. 
 	

## Instructions to Replicators

- Run the three R scripts described above.


## Reproducibility


The provided code reproduces:

- [x] All numbers provided in text in the paper
- [ ] All tables and figures in the paper
